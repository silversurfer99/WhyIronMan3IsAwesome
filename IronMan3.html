        <div><h2>By: John Lezama</h2></div>

        <div><p>Iron Man 3, on of the most divisive movies the MCU has made to date. Some people( particularly snobbish
            scottish ones) tend to see this as a particularly bad movie at least relative to the awesomeness the MCU
            has annualy and consistently produced. However, I am here to say that Iron Man 3 is easily one of the best
            movies in the MCU and here are the reasons why:
        </p></div>
        <div><h2>It Gives Us The Most In Depth Inspection Of Tony Stark:</h2></div>
        <p>As we all know, Tony Stark is the most profitable and one of the best characters in the entirety of cinema
            so a movie that really shows who he is, without the suit, is something that is bound to be awesome and great.
            The movie starts out with him being affected by the events that occured in the 2012's Avengers and his response
            to it was to devote all of his time to making more and better suits. However, this started pushing him away from his
            friends and loved ones and when the events in the movie force him to be without his suit, he proves he is very capable
            all on his own. This is all later shown at the end of the movie where he blows up his iron legion and recognizes that he 
            is Iron Man, not the suit.
        </p>
        <div><h2>It Deals With PTSD From The Avengers:</h2></div>
        <div><p>In the Avengers, the movie before this one came out, Tony Stark teams up with Captain America, Hawkeye, Thor,
            Black Widow, and the Hulk to battle Loki and the alien army that attacks New York city. Tony Stark, being a
            human, suffers PTSD from this attack which is a very realistic and accurate reaction Tony Stark, who previously faced
            human threats, would have. This provides us an opening to really dive into his character as I explained in the reason above.
        </p></div>
        <div><h2>The Mandarin:</h2></div>
        <div><p>When the Trevor Slattery first appeared in the movie I thought,"So a random terrorist is making threats on the US... cool". 
            I however was pleasantly surprised when this turned out to be false and he was actually a junkie which made for a hularious scene
            between Iron Man, War Machine, and The Mandarin. I also thought that this was a very fresh and clever way to introduce the 
            Aldrich Killians plot as providing a scapegoat would mean that he is not a target, leaving him free to do whatever he wanted 
            in the shadows.
        </p></div>
        <div><h2>The Theme Song:</h2></div>
        <div><p>Before this movie Iron Man didn't really have a theme song. Sure you could've said that it was Black Sabbath's 
            Iron Man but that was kind of abandoned in Iron Man 2 anyway. However in Iron Man 3 they created a whole new theme song 
            that I just thought was A, just a fantastic theme song, and B, worked really well with Iron Man and the movie itself.
            This was also highlited in the awesome credits of the movie.
        </p></div>
        <div><h2>The Credits:</h2></div>
        <div><p>I don't know about you but the credits to this movie is something that I could just watch all day. First of all it had the
            fantatsic theme song playing and second of all it showed scenes from Iron Man 1, 2, and 3 which is something that I just absolutely
            loved. It also had a comic book theming to it which I also really enjoyed.
        </p></div>
        <div><h2>Levon Hated It:</h2></div>
        <div><p>This one is pretty obvious. Levon... we all hate him, so him not liking it simply means that literally everyone else must have 
            absolutely loved it. He's an idiot and I just can't stand the dude so in a way him not liking it makes me enjoy it even more.
        </p></div>
        <div><h2>Conclusion:</h2></div>
        <div><p>In conclusion I think it's pretty obvious that Iron Man 3 is easily THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME and should be loved and treasured
            accordingly. From just a lot of screen time of Tony Stark himself to the awesome Iron Man scenes and theme song 
            to the hilarious and fun twist of the Mandarin, I just can't get enough of this movie.
